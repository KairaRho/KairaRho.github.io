        <!-- All my information --> 
        <h3> My name is Kaira Cho-Repelis,</h3>
        <h3> and I am 15 years old. </h3> 
        <p> I lived in Lower Hutt, Wellington from when I was born to the age of 8. When I was 9 we had already moved to Palmerston North and I have lived here ever since. </p>
        <p> My ethnic background is a mix of Chinese and Filipino.  I do not speak or understand any Filipino, but I do speak a little bit of Chinese (Cantonese) and understand it to a certain extent. In my Filipino side that part of my family speaks the dialect of 'Tagalog'. </p>
        <p> Another thing about me is that our family has welcomed a lot of International Students into our home as we are a 'Homestay family'. We have been looking after many students from different backgrounds and cultures since I came here to Palmerston North when I was 9 in 2011.   </p>
